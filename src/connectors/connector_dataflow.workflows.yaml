# [START workflows_connector_dataflow]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Dataflow connector.
# The workflow creates a word count job using a Dataflow public job template
# and uses a Cloud Storage bucket as temporary storage for temp files.
# The bucket resource is deleted after the job completes.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
