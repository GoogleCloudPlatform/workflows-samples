# [START workflows_connector_cloudfunctions]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Functions connector.
# This workflow creates a function from a zip archive containing the source code stored in a Cloud Storage bucket:
# gs://your-bucket/cloud-function-source.zip.
# Make sure cloud-function-source.zip contains properly structured Cloud Functions source code and the function returns
# "success" when triggered.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
