# [START workflows_connector_cloudscheduler]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Scheduler connector.
# This workflow creates a Pub/Sub topic and a subscription to the topic which is used by Cloud Scheduler
# as a notification method. The workflow then creates a scheduler job, waits for the job to finish, and pulls the notification from
# the subscription. It then deletes all resources.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
