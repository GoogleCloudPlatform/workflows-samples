# [START workflows_connector_secretmanager]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Secret Manager connector to.
# retrieve a secret.
# Expected successful output: the secret data.

- init:
    assign:
    - project_id: ${sys.get_env("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID")}
    - secret_id: "test-secret"  # Make sure you have this secret and it has a version of 1.
    - version: "1"
# Note that accessRaw is the preferred way to access the secret data as it requires no
# base64 decoding and field indexing. To compare the usage between accessRaw() and access(),
# we list two demo steps to retrieve the same secret below.
- get_raw_secret:
    call: googleapis.secretmanager.v1.projects.secrets.versions.accessRaw
    args:
      secret_id: ${secret_id}
      version: ${version}  # If not set, "latest" will be used.
      project_id: ${project_id}
    result: raw_secret
- get_secret:
    call: googleapis.secretmanager.v1.projects.secrets.versions.access
    args:
      name: ${"projects/" + project_id + "/secrets/" + secret_id + "/versions/" + version}
    result: base64_encoded_secret_data
# Secret can also be retrieved by using positional arguments in an expression.
- expression:
    assign:
    - raw_secret_from_exp: ${googleapis.secretmanager.v1.projects.secrets.versions.accessRaw(secret_id, version, project_id)}
- the_end:
    return: [${raw_secret}, ${raw_secret_from_exp}, ${text.decode(base64.decode(base64_encoded_secret.payload.data))}]
