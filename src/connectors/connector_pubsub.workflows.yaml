# [START workflows_connector_pubsub]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Pub/Sub connector.
# The workflow creates a Pub/Sub topic, a new subscription to that new topic, publishes a new message to
# the topic, pulls the message from the subscription, and then deletes both
# the subscription and the topic.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
