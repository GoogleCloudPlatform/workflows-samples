# [START workflows_connector_container]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Kubernetes Engine connector.
# The workflow creates a GKE cluster and then deletes it.
# Each of these steps waits until the long-running operation of creating or deleting the GKE
# cluster is completed.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
