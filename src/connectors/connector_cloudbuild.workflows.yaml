# [START workflows_connector_cloudbuild]
# This workflow demonstrates how to use the Cloud Build connector.
# The workflow creates a simple build and the image is stored to an Artifact Registery repo.
# The workflow assumes a properly defined source tgz file already
# exists in a Cloud Storage bucket: gs://your-project-id_cloudbuild/source/placeholder_src.tgz
# and a repository "your-project-id-docker-repo" already
# exists in Artifact Registry where the image will be stored.
# The new table and dataset are both deleted in the following steps.
# Expected successful output: "SUCCESS"
